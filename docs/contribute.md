# How to Contribute to Beacon Development

The Beacon API & standard is a driver project of the Global Alliance for Genomics
and Health [**GA4GH**](https://ga4gh.org). Since 2016 Beacon development has been 
organized through projects supported by ELIXIR with additional contributions from
outside organizations and individual developers and implementers.

The easiest way to contribute to Beacon development - or to enquire about or 
request additional features - is through the project's Github{{config.repo_icon}} [issues]({{config.repo_url}}/issues) and [discussions]({{config.repo_url}}/discussions).
