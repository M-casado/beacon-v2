        \ count of material from the genomic region between\n    `start` and `end`\
        \ positions\n  - no assumption about the placement of the additional sequences\
        \ is being\n    made (i.e. no _in situ_ requirement as tandem duplications)\n\
        * DEL: deletion of sequence following `start` The Beacon model is not prescriptive\
        \ with regard to the values allowed for `variantType` with use of extended\
        \ types (such as from `EFO:0030063`) being permitted. However, a support for\
